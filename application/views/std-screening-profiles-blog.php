                    <h4>STD Screening Profiles: From Simple Checkups to Full Sexual Health Panels</h4>

                    <!-- Intro -->
                    <p>Sexual health is not only about avoiding infection. It is about peace of mind, confidence with your partner, and protecting your fertility and long term health. Many sexually transmitted infections can stay completely silent for months or even years. That is why structured STD screening is so valuable.</p>

                    <p>At healthcarebia, STD testing is organised into clear panels. Each panel includes a specific group of markers chosen by doctors to answer real world clinical questions. Instead of guessing which single test you need, you choose the panel that matches your situation, symptoms, and risk level.</p>

                    <p>This guide walks you through:</p>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li>Why STD screening matters</li>
                        <li>What each healthcarebia STD panel includes</li>
                        <li>Which panel suits which type of person</li>
                        <li>How healthcarebia supports your health beyond STD testing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- Why STD screening matters -->
                    <h5>Why STD Screening Matters</h5>
                    <p>Many infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea can show no symptoms at all. You may feel well, but still pass infection to a partner or allow it to slowly damage your reproductive system.</p>
                    <p>Regular screening helps you:</p>
                    <ul class="tick-list">
                        <li><strong>Detect infections early:</strong> so treatment is simpler and more effective.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect your partner:</strong> by avoiding unplanned transmission.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lower the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility:</strong> which can follow untreated infections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make informed decisions:</strong> about contraception, pregnancy, and your sexual and reproductive health.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- How panels work -->
                    <h5>How Healthcarebia STD Panels Work</h5>
                    <p>Each STD panel is a group of tests run together on your sample. As the panel number increases, the breadth of information and the number of organisms checked also increases.</p>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li><strong>Lower panels:</strong> focus on core, common STDs that most people worry about.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mid level panels:</strong> add herpes, syphilis, yeast, and more bacterial vaginosis related markers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Advanced panels:</strong> add full vaginal microbiome analysis and blood borne infections such as HIV and viral hepatitis.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Below is a panel by panel explanation so you can see where you fit.</p>

                    <!-- STD 7 Panel -->
                    <h5>STD 7 Panel &ndash; Core Essential STD Screen</h5>
                    <p><strong>What this panel checks</strong></p>
                    <p>The STD 7 Panel is the starting point for many patients. It focuses on common bacterial and parasitic infections that affect the urethra, cervix, and genital tract. These are the typical infections picked up after unprotected sex or a new partner.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who this panel is for</strong></p>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li>Anyone who wants a basic STD checkup.</li>
                        <li>People with mild or recent symptoms such as burning or discharge.</li>
                        <li>Those with a new sexual partner or after unprotected sex.</li>
                        <li>Individuals without long term or complex genital symptoms.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- STD 14 Panel -->
                    <h5>STD 14 Panel &ndash; Extended STD Plus BV and Herpes Coverage</h5>
                    <p><strong>What this panel checks</strong></p>
                    <p>The STD 14 Panel builds on the 7 Panel and adds key organisms linked with genital ulcers, herpes, and bacterial vaginosis. It gives a more complete picture for people with more specific symptoms or a higher risk pattern.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who this panel is for</strong></p>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li>People with ulcers, blisters, or sores in the genital area.</li>
                        <li>Those with strong odour, thin discharge, or suspected bacterial vaginosis.</li>
                        <li>Anyone who wants a wider screen that includes herpes and syphilis related markers as well as basic bacterial STDs.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- STD 17 Panel -->
                    <h5>STD 17 Panel &ndash; Focus on Recurrent or Resistant Yeast Infections</h5>
                    <p><strong>What this panel checks</strong></p>
                    <p>The STD 17 Panel includes everything in the 14 Panel and adds several non albicans Candida species. This matters in recurrent or treatment resistant thrush where standard medication is no longer working well.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who this panel is for</strong></p>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li>People with recurrent vaginal yeast infections.</li>
                        <li>Patients whose symptoms return quickly after standard antifungal treatment.</li>
                        <li>Those with a mix of STD and thrush symptoms where the cause is unclear.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- STD 21 Panel -->
                    <h5>STD 21 Panel &ndash; Broad STD Plus Blood Borne Infection Screen</h5>
                    <p><strong>What this panel checks</strong></p>
                    <p>The STD 21 Panel combines genital infections, bacterial vaginosis related organisms, Candida species, and major blood borne infections. It is a comprehensive sexual health screen in a single profile.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who this panel is for</strong></p>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li>People with higher risk exposure, such as unprotected sex with multiple partners.</li>
                        <li>Those who want a single, broad STD screen including HIV and hepatitis markers.</li>
                        <li>Couples starting a new relationship and testing together.</li>
                        <li>Patients whose doctor has advised full STD and blood borne infection screening.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- STD 28 Panel -->
                    <h5>STD 28 Panel &ndash; Advanced Vaginal Microbiome and STD Panel</h5>
                    <p><strong>What this panel checks</strong></p>
                    <p>The STD 28 Panel still includes core STD markers but adds a deep analysis of the vaginal microbiome and additional viruses and bacteria that influence genital health and pregnancy outcomes. This is helpful when symptoms are chronic, complex, or unexplained.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who this panel is for</strong></p>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li>People with chronic or recurrent discharge and odour.</li>
                        <li>Patients who have had several treatments without lasting improvement.</li>
                        <li>Women planning pregnancy or fertility treatment who want a detailed view of vaginal health.</li>
                        <li>Individuals whose basic STD panels were negative but symptoms continued.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- STD 32 Panel -->
                    <h5>STD 32 Panel &ndash; Full Spectrum STD and Microbiome Assessment</h5>
                    <p><strong>What this panel checks</strong></p>
                    <p>The STD 32 Panel combines everything in the advanced 28 Panel with blood borne infection markers. It is the most complete option in this series and is designed as a full spectrum look at sexual health.</p>
                    <p><strong>Who this panel is for</strong></p>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li>People who want a once only, full sexual health and microbiome assessment.</li>
                        <li>Individuals with long standing or complex symptoms where basic tests were not enough.</li>
                        <li>Higher risk patients who prefer one comprehensive panel instead of multiple separate tests.</li>
                        <li>Those undergoing preconception or pre fertility workups where doctors want a wide safety check.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- Why choose healthcarebia -->
                    <h5>Why Choose Healthcarebia for STD Screening</h5>
