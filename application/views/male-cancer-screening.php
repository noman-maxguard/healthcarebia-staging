                            <p>This type of screening may be considered by men who are in midlife or older, those with a family history of certain cancers, or individuals with lifestyle or medical risk factors identified by their clinician. It can also be helpful for men who want a more structured way to review their health rather than waiting for symptoms to appear.</p>

                            <p>No. Male Cancer Screening on its own does not diagnose cancer. It looks for signs or markers that may need further evaluation. An abnormal or borderline result does not mean you have cancer, and a normal result does not guarantee that cancer is absent. Only a qualified clinician can interpret your results, examine you, and decide whether additional tests or referrals are needed.</p>
