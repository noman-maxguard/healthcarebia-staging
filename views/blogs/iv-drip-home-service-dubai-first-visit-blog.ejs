        <h4>What Happens During Your First IV Drip Session?</h4>
        <h5>1) Quick Consultation</h5>
        <p>
          You'll start with a short chat—either on the phone or in person—with a certified medical
          professional. They'll ask about your health history, symptoms, and goals to recommend the
          right blend for you.
        </p>
        <h5>2) Easy Booking</h5>
        <p>
          Pick a time that works for you, and that's it. No hidden fees; pricing is clearly laid out
          during scheduling.
        </p>
        <h5>3) Nurse Visit</h5>
        <p>
          At your scheduled time, a licensed nurse arrives with everything needed: medical‑grade
          equipment, top‑quality infusions, and a calm, professional vibe. All you have to do is
          relax.
        </p>
        <h5>4) During the Drip</h5>
        <p>
          The session typically lasts about 30–60 minutes depending on your chosen cocktail. Read a
          book, watch a show, or just chill—whatever helps you feel at ease.
        </p>
        <h5>5) After the Treatment</h5>
        <p>
          Many people feel a boost in energy, mental clarity, and hydration almost immediately.
          Aftercare is minimal: drink plenty of water, and follow any simple advice from your nurse.
        </p>

          <li>Feeling run‑down or low on energy</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Is It Safe?</h4>

          Yes. When performed by DHA‑certified professionals, at‑home IV therapy is safe, regulated,
          and reliable. Drips use high‑quality ingredients and strict hygiene protocols.
        </p>

          Minor effects are uncommon, but you might notice slight bruising or a little redness at
          the insertion site. These are usually mild and fade quickly without special care.
