                            <p>The Hair Loss Test is an assessment designed to explore possible factors that may be contributing to hair thinning or hair fall.

                            <p>This test considers several areas that may be linked to hair loss. These can include inherited or family patterns of hair thinning, lifestyle factors such as stress, sleep and nutrition, and aspects of your overall health. Together, these insights help build a more complete picture of how your daily life and wellbeing may be reflected in your hair health.</p>

                            <p>This assessment may be helpful for people who have noticed ongoing hair thinning, widening of the part line, increased shedding or patchy areas of hair loss. It can also support anyone who is concerned about how their lifestyle, stress levels or general health might be affecting their hair and would like structured guidance rather than guessing or trying random treatments.</p>
