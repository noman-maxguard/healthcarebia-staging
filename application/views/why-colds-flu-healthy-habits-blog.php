                    <h4>Why Do You Still Catch Colds and Flu Even with Healthy Habits?</h4>

                    <p>Even with nutritious food, exercise, and good habits, colds and flu can still break through. Stress, sleep, hydration, micronutrients, gut health, and your daily environment all influence how well your immune system responds. Below is a practical guide to strengthen your defenses and where supportive options like IV drip home service in Dubai may help.</p>

                    <!-- Stress & Sleep -->
                    <h5>Stress and Sleep Deprivation</h5>
                    <p>Stress elevates cortisol, which can dampen immune responses. Adults sleeping fewer than seven hours nightly are more likely to catch common respiratory infections.</p>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li>Create a consistent bedtime routine</li>
                        <li>Limit screens 60 minutes before bed</li>
                        <li>Use meditation or breathing drills</li>
                        <li>Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- Environment -->
                    <h5>Environmental Exposure</h5>
                    <p>Crowded offices, schools, and public transport increase viral exposure. Air-conditioning or heating can dry nasal passages and reduce natural defenses. Simple changes help: open windows when possible, use a humidifier, sanitize hands, and regularly clean high touch items like phones and keyboards.</p>

                    <!-- Hydration -->
                    <h5>Hydration Matters</h5>
                    <p>Hydration supports nutrient transport, detox pathways, and moist mucous membranes that trap pathogens. In hot climates like Dubai or during workouts fluid needs rise. If you struggle to maintain intake, IV infusion therapy at home can rapidly restore fluids and electrolytes as a supplemental option.</p>

                    <!-- Micronutrients -->
                    <h5>Micronutrient Deficiencies</h5>
                    <p>Even balanced diets can miss essentials such as vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, and magnesium. Consider periodic blood tests or preventive health check-ups in Dubai to identify gaps. Some choose antioxidant, vitamin, or Myers Cocktail IV therapy for faster bioavailability compared to oral supplements.</p>

                    <!-- Exercise balance -->
                    <h5>Exercise, Too Much or Too Little</h5>
                    <p>Moderate, regular movement supports immune health; overtraining can do the opposite. Watch for warning signs like persistent fatigue, soreness, sleep disruption, or frequent illness. Active individuals sometimes explore NAD IV therapy or NAD+ IV drips in Dubai to support recovery.</p>

                    <!-- Gut health -->
                    <h5>Gut Health and Immunity</h5>
                    <p>Much of the immune system is connected to the gut. Build a diverse microbiome with probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut) and prebiotic foods (onions, garlic, bananas, whole grains). Some residents pair these dietary steps with home IV therapy in Dubai such as immune boost or vitamin IV drips to complement overall wellness goals.</p>

                    <!-- Habits & hygiene -->
                    <h5>Habits and Hygiene</h5>
                    <p>Small behaviors shape outcomes. Avoid touching your face, wash hands frequently, and don’t share utensils or water bottles. Keep personal items separate, especially while traveling.</p>
                    <ul class="tick-list">
                        <li>Disinfect phones, keyboards, and doorknobs</li>
                        <li>Carry sanitizer on commutes and flights</li>
                        <li>Use tissues and dispose immediately</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- Individual differences -->
                    <h5>Differences in Immune System</h5>
                    <p>Age, genetics, and medical conditions influence immune responses. Two people can be exposed to the same virus and have very different outcomes. The realistic goal is risk reduction, not total prevention.</p>

                    <!-- Lifestyle checklist -->
                    <h5>Lifestyle Adjustments That Add Up</h5>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li>Prioritize sleep and stress management</li>
                        <li>Stay hydrated throughout the day</li>
                        <li>Balance training with recovery</li>
                        <li>Include probiotics and prebiotics</li>
                        <li>Practice daily hygiene habits</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For added resilience, many opt for premium IV drips at home in Dubai such as immune support blends or adjunct services like hyperbaric oxygen therapy via VIP home healthcare providers.</p>

                    <!-- Nurse perspective -->
                    <h5>Nurse’s Perspective</h5>
                    <p>Patients often maintain “perfect” diet and gym habits yet still fall sick due to stress, sleep deficits, dehydration, or nutrient gaps. Simple tweaks drinking more water, adding fermented foods, or booking at-home lab tests in Dubai (female hormone profiles, STD panels, even DNA health testing) can make a noticeable difference.</p>

                    <!-- Additional Support -->
                    <h5>Additional Support: Multivitamin & Specialty IV Drips</h5>
                    <ul class="ingredients-list">
                        <li><a href="<?= base_url() ?>myers-iv-drip"><strong>Myers IV drip</strong></a> for general energy and immune support</li>
                        <li><a href="<?= base_url() ?>nad-iv-drip"><strong>NAD IV drip</strong></a> for recovery and anti-ageing goals</li>
                        <li><a href="<?= base_url() ?>iv-drip-dubai"><strong>Custom IV cocktails</strong></a> for hydration and performance</li>
                        <li><a href="<?= base_url() ?>lab-test-at-home"><strong>At-home tests</strong></a> like ancestry DNA tests in UAE or STD testing for deeper insights</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When delivered via IV drip at home in Dubai, these options can suit busy professionals, frequent travelers, or those recovering from illness subject to clinical screening.</p>

                    <!-- Conclusion -->
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <p>Catching colds or flu isn’t a failure of healthy living. It often signals blind spots in stress, sleep, hydration, nutrients, or daily exposures. Blend lifestyle upgrades with professional support like best IV drip therapy in Dubai, VIP IV therapy at home, or targeted lab tests to build durable resilience and enjoy fewer sick days.</p>
