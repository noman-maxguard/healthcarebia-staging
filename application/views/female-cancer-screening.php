                            <p>Depending on the specific package, the screening profile may include tests that are commonly used to assess risk or look for early signs of cancers such as breast, cervical, ovarian or other female-related cancers. This can involve imaging, laboratory tests and a review of your symptoms, family history, age and lifestyle factors, helping your clinician build a clearer picture of your overall health and screening needs.</p>

                            <p>This assessment may be helpful for women who wish to take a proactive approach to their health, especially those in recommended screening age groups, with a family history of certain cancers, or with ongoing symptoms that need further evaluation.

                            <p>No. The Women’s Cancer Screening Profile alone does not diagnose cancer and cannot guarantee that cancer is absent.

Only a qualified clinician can make a diagnosis or provide treatment recommendations after reviewing your complete health picture.</p>
