                            <p>No. The Psoriasis Investigation Test by itself does not diagnose psoriasis and cannot fully explain its cause.

Only a qualified clinician can make a diagnosis and suggest treatment options after reviewing your overall health picture.</p>

Your report is shared through secure and confidential channels. You can then review the findings with your dermatologist or healthcare professional, who will help interpret the results in context and guide you on suitable skin care, lifestyle changes or further evaluation rather than making changes on your own.</p>
