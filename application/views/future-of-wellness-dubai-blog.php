                    <p>In a world that’s constantly evolving, so is the way we approach health. From personalized medicine to holistic self-care, people are redefining what it means to be well. The global wellness economy, now valued in the trillions, has shifted rapidly, fueled by lifestyle changes, technology, and a collective desire for longer, healthier lives.</p>
                    <p>As we embrace 2025, here are the biggest health and wellness trends shaping the future. Whether you’re a wellness enthusiast, health professional, or simply looking to live better, these insights will help you navigate what’s next.</p>

                    <!-- 1. Personalized Wellness -->

                    <p>One-size-fits-all advice is fading. People want plans tailored to their biology,using DNA insights, metabolic markers, and lifestyle data. Clinics and apps now use genetic profiles to design customized fitness routines, diet plans, and supplementation.</p>
                    <p>At Healthcarebia, we integrate DNA testing with IV drip therapy to target individual nutrient needs. Examples include:</p>
