                            <p>The Female Hormone Profile is a group of tests and assessments designed to support the evaluation of hormone balance across different stages of a woman’s life. It provides structured information that you and your healthcare professional can use when discussing symptoms, menstrual cycles, fertility, perimenopause or menopause, and possible next steps for care.</p>

                            <p>Depending on the specific package, the profile may include blood tests that look at hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH, prolactin and others, as well as sometimes thyroid or related markers. These results are considered together with information about your symptoms, menstrual pattern, contraception or medication use, family history and lifestyle to help build a clearer picture of your overall hormonal health.</p>

                            <p>This assessment may be helpful for women who experience symptoms that could be related to hormone imbalance, such as irregular periods, heavy or very light bleeding, mood changes, hot flashes, low energy, skin or hair changes, weight fluctuations or difficulties with fertility. It can also support women who are approaching menopause or already post-menopausal and would like structured information to discuss with their healthcare professional.</p>

                            <p>No. The Female Hormone Profile alone does not provide a full diagnosis of any specific hormone condition.
