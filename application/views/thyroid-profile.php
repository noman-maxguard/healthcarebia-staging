                            hyperthyroidism. The test provides crucial insights into overall thyroid health.</p>

                            <p>Depending on the specific package, the profile may include blood tests that look at thyroid hormones (such as TSH, T3 and T4) and, in some cases, related markers like thyroid antibodies or other parameters.
