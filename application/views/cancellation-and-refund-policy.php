            <p><b>If an appointment is abandoned,</b> the client will be charged the <b>full price</b> of the reserved appointment price. This fee applies in the following circumstances, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul class="commen-listing mb-3">
                <li>Nurse dispatched but client unable to receive service because information was not disclosed at the time of booking (example: alcohol withdrawal, drug abuse)</li>
                <li>Nurse dispatched but client unable to receive service because customers observations/vitals signs are out of range</li>
                <li>Nurse dispatched, service not completed due to the client’s physical or mental condition (example: could not tolerate it, Vasovagaled and did not want to continue)</li>
                <li>Nurse dispatched but service not completed because of time constraints</li>
                <li>Unsafe or unsanitary environment</li>

            <p>This fee will also apply should the client facilitate a hostile or unsafe environment as perceived by the nurse during the visit. This provision does not apply if the session proceeds normally in which case the client will only be liable for the normal cost of the service.

            <p>Nurse dispatched but unable to start IV after 3 (three) attempts. Note: The nurse must be allowed to attempt the placement at least thrice. If the client chooses not to continue after the first or second attempts, then 50% of <b>the fee will apply.</b></p>

            <p>If a nurse has already been dispatched to the client’s location, or if you are not present at the given address within 10 minutes of the nurse’s arrival, you will be charged in full to the held card on file.</p>
