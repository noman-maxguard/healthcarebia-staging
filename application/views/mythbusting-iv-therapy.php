                    </ul>
                    <h5>Introduction</h5>
                    <p>Intravenous (IV) therapy has become very popular in Dubai. It delivers fluids, vitamins, and minerals directly into your bloodstream. You get rapid rehydration and a fast nutrient boost. Yet many people still ask: Is it safe? Does it hurt? Don’t I get enough vitamins from food and drinking water? In this guide, we will clear up the top IV drip myths. We’ll share the facts, answer your IV treatment FAQs, and help you decide if an IV therapy session is right for you.</p>
                    <h5>1. Myth: “IV Therapy Is Painful and Invasive”</h5>
                    <ul class="tick-list">
                        <li><strong>Ultra-fine Needles:</strong> Modern IV catheters are as thin as a hair. You feel only a quick pinch, not deep pain.</li>
                        <li><strong>Expert Hands:</strong> Our nurses have years of experience in safe IV placement, ensuring first-try success.</li>
                        <li><strong>Relaxed Setting:</strong> Enjoy a comfy recliner, soft music, and gentle lighting. Scroll your phone or nap during infusion.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>2. Myth: “IV Therapy Is Unsafe, It’s Only for Hospitals”</h5>
                    <ul class="tick-list">
                        <li><strong>Sterile, Single-Use Supplies:</strong> Every IV bag, tube, and needle is new, sealed, and discarded after one use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Physician-Approved Formulas:</strong> All IV fluids and vitamin blends are signed off by a doctor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Emergency Readiness:</strong> Nurses carry life-support gear and train in first aid for rare complications.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><strong>Rapid Rehydration:</strong> Drinking water can take hours; an IV can hydrate you in 20–30 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Balanced Electrolytes:</strong> IV fluids restore sodium, potassium, and magnesium fast, supporting muscles and nerves.</li>

                        <li><strong>Wellness Applications:</strong> Studies show IV vitamin C cuts cold symptoms faster; B12 drips boost energy and mood.</li>
                    </ul>
